## Decisions on UI

DaisyUI - halloween theme
table -> "Table with visual elements"
range -> "primary color" (for refresh rate)
checkbox -> "primary color" (to choose boolean, exchanges etc)
toggle -> w/e (refresh or no)
tooltip -> "hover" to explain all concepts etc

on futures with spot:
Basis: picture of exchange, name, expiry, apy, fut price, spot price, delta, trade_setup(hover)

on perp with spot:
Funding: picture of exchange, name, apy, perp price, spot price, delta, trade_setup(hover)
